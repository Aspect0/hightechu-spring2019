# Assignment 7

In this assignment you will have the oppurtunity to create a GitHub Account and either download and upload your teams project or fork your teams project.

## Create a GitHub Account

If you don't have a Personal GitHub Account follow the instructions below to create an account.

Head over to: https://github.com/join?source=header-home and create your personal account.

**NOTE**: Your HighTechU GitHub Account will be deleted, so please make sure to create your own account.

## Acquire HighTechU Team Project Repository

There are two options available for acquiring a copy of your teams project repository.

### Option 1 (Recommended)

1. Head over to your teams GitHub Repository
2. Click the "Clone or download" button
3. Click the "Download ZIP"
4. Unzip the folder
5. Follow 1 of these instructions:
  * Command line: https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line
  * GitHub Desktop: https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/adding-a-repository-from-your-local-computer-to-github-desktop

**NOTE**: This will only download and upload the master branch, make sure everything you need is on the master branch.

### Option 2

1. Head over to your teams GitHub Repository

**NOTE**: If the HighTechU Teams Project GitHub Repository ever gets deleted, you will lose your fork. This is why option 1 is recommended.
